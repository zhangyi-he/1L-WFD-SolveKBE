# Estimation of natural selection and allele age from time series allele frequency data using a novel likelihood-based approach
Source code is implemented for a likelihood-based method for inferring natural selection and allele age from time series data of allele frequencies, and the article has been published in Genetics available at https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.120.303400.

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case of constant demographies.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case of non-constant demographies.
