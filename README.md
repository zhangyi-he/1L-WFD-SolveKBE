# Maximum likelihood estimation of natural selection and allele age from time series data of allele frequencies
Source code is implemented for a likelihood-based method for inferring natural selection and allele age from time series data of allele frequencies, and the preprint is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837310v1

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case that non-constant demographies are not allowed.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case that non-constant demographies are allowed.
